    "\n",
    "- Steam is a video game digital distribution service. It has a marketplace where users can purchase games as well as several community features such as friends lists, groups, cloud storage, and in-game voice and chat functionality.\n",
    "- In 2019 Steam had over 34,000 games with over 95 million monthly active users and in 2017 (last year available) purchases through Steam totaled $4.3 billion US dollars.\n",
    "- My project is to train a recommender system for Steam."

    "### Recommender Systems Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **recommender system** is a model that seeks to predict the preferences a user would give to a collection of items.\n",
    "- Two major classes: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering, although novel hybrid methods are also being developed.\n",
    "- **Content-based filtering** create \"profiles\" of different classes of items and recommending users items from similar profiles to items they have already rated. \n",
    "    - Often implemented via k-means clustering, bayesian classifiers, decision trees, and artificial neural networks\n",
    "    - Pros: easier to train, can make recommendations with relatively little info on the user\n",
    "    - Cons: \"echo chamber\" effect, hard to implement across content types\n",
    "- **Collaborative filtering** identify similar users based upon known common ratings, then recommend items to a target user based on what other similar users have rated highly.\n",
    "    - Often implemented via nearest-neighbor algorithms or by matrix factorization models.\n",
    "    - Pros: does not rely on content features, can learn preferences soley from user interactions with content\n",
    "    - Cons: \"cold start problem\", scalability, sparsity\n",
    "    \n",
    "For this project we will implement a collaborative filtering model based on a matrix factorization model."

However, by exploiting the special form our loss function takes we can actually minimize the loss much faster using the ALS method which we explain below.\n",

Thus we solve these problems for each row of $U$ and update $U$ accordingly.\n",
